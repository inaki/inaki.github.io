        <p class="resume-description">
          I worked with the government of West Sacramento to empower citizen urban farmers with technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside a designer and a developer, our team conducted research in the community to develop 3 web applications. Our applications <a href="http://acres.online">Acres</a> and <a href="http://westsacramentourbanfarm.com/">Farmer's</a> raised awareness about the opportunities for current and aspiring farmers to start growing food in the city. For <a href="http://westsacramentourbanfarm.com/">Farmer's</a> I was responsible for the full-stack development, and on <a href="http://acres.online">Acres</a> I did the design and front-end development.

        <p class="resume-description">
          At i-comm I served in 2 capacities: I was the sole designer and front-end developer, as well as an ambassador for the company in the local tech scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          I attended client pitch meetings and prototyped, then built applications for their needs. Additionally, I worked with the company's CEO to establish the first maker-coworking space in Puerto Rico (<a href="http://www.engine-4.com/">Engine 4</a>), turning unused office space into a daily hub for makers and technologists.
