	Niñas Code Club (2015 - present) <br>

Every Saturday morning, I co-teach a group of kids (~ages 9-12) about basic HTML, CSS, and design. Many of these kids are first generation Americans, whose parents immigrated from Peru and want their sons & daughters to have a leg up with technology. It’s important to me (and fun for me!) to share what I know about coding and design, and help further the future of young latinos.
